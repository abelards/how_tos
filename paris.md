# Welcome
Welcome to Paris, fellow rubyist, how can we help?

Let's find places you can visit, walk around, eat at, go to or sleep in.
Feel free to comment!

## Visit
"What to do?" http://quefaire.paris.fr/ also with a "kids" version: http://quefaire.paris.fr/enfants

To-dos:
* Monuments
* Places & Museums
For non-obvious travels: http://www.transilien.com/static/touristique/info-touristique
  - Louvre
  - Notre-Dame (note the very nice Archaeologic Crypt, underneath the place. Stairs on the opposite side of the place)
  - Versailles (the travel is not obvious: RER C to Versailles Rive Gauche, "porte de Versailles" tram & metro do not lead there)
  - Palais de la Découverte

* Parks & walks
Paris is actually very small.
Walking along the river Seine from the Tour Eiffel to Notre Dame will lead you to most landmarks quite pleasantly.

  - Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle & Jardin des Plantes
  - 12th: Promenade Plantée, from Bastille to Vincennes http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promenade_plantée
  - 13th: Parc Montsouris, Cité des Fleurs, Petite Alsace
  - 14th: Catacombes, I recommend coming in early (also, it's cold, and not disabled-friendly: there are 120 steps down and 83 steps up)
  - 18th: Montmartre
  - 19th: Père Lachaise
  - 19th: La Villette has Cité des Sciences, la Géode, and you can walk the canals to Bastille
  - 20th: Campagne à Paris
  - Bagatelle, Jardin d'Acclimatation

## Food
We the french are passionate about food. Best addresses are open for debate.
Previous great locations include Le Pied de Cochon and le Louchebem.

## Travel
I like to walk and use the metro and buses.
If you're moving a lot, look for unlimited tickets for your stay, for convenience.
If you're just having one or two journeys a day, that might not be necessary.

## Lodging
The usual for a big city and european capital I guess.
