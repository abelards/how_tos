# Welcome
Welcome to Paris, fellow rubyist, how can we help?

Let's find places you can visit, walk around, eat at, go to or sleep in.
And most importantly, find WiFi!
Feel free to comment.

## Visit
"What to do?" http://quefaire.paris.fr/ also with a "kids" version: http://quefaire.paris.fr/enfants

Paris is actually very small.
Walking along the river Seine from the Tour Eiffel to Notre Dame will lead you to most landmarks quite pleasantly.
I like parks but you might not be impressed. They are nice places to relax and hang out though. Most of them have WiFi!

* ** Monuments, Places & Museums**
  - Le Louvre (you'd need a few full days: plan a long trip and ticket, or just go to your favorite things. I like ancient Egypt ^^)
  - Notre-Dame (note the very nice Archaeologic Crypt, underneath the place. Stairs on the opposite side of the place)
  - Versailles (the travel is not obvious: RER C to Versailles Rive Gauche, "porte de Versailles" tram & metro do not lead there)
  - Palais de la Découverte
  - 14th: Catacombes, I recommend coming in early (also, it's cold, and not disabled-friendly: there are 120 steps down and 83 steps up)

* **Parks & walks**
  - Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle & Jardin des Plantes
  - 12th: Promenade Plantée, from Bastille to Vincennes http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promenade_plantée
  - 13th: Parc Montsouris, Cité des Fleurs, Petite Alsace
  - 18th: Montmartre
  - 19th: Père Lachaise
  - 19th: La Villette has Cité des Sciences, la Géode, and you can walk the canals to Bastille
  - 20th: Campagne à Paris
  - Bagatelle, Jardin d'Acclimatation

## Food
We the french are passionate about food. Best addresses are open for debate.
Previous great locations include Le Pied de Cochon and le Louchebem.

## Travel
I like to walk and use the metro and buses.
If you're moving a lot, look for unlimited tickets for your stay, for convenience.
If you're just having one or two journeys a day, that might not be necessary.

## Lodging
The usual for a big city and european capital I guess.
